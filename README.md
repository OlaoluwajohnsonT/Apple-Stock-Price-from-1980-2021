Performed Stock Price Prediction and EDA on Apple finance Data.



The dataset for Stock Prediction on Apple Inc. spans a comprehensive timeframe, ranging from 1980 to 2021, and was meticulously collected from Yahoo Finance. This dataset presents an exciting opportunity for Time Series Analysis (TSA) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns within Apple Inc.'s stock market performance over four decades. Time series analysis allows us to dissect historical stock price trends and predict future movements, while EDA enables a deep understanding of the data's characteristics. By applying these analytical techniques, I aim to provide valuable insights and informed predictions that can be of significant relevance to investors, financial analysts, and enthusiasts interested in Apple's stock market dynamics.
